<h1 id="hwgh">How we got here</h1>

<p>Security used to concern protecting our most valuable physical assets, often behind locked doors in vaults and safes. Now, thanks to advancements in computing/computer science, our most valued assets are often in the form of digital information. This makes our information nearly cost-free to duplicate, convenient to intercept and increasingly cheap to store in massive quantities.</p>

<p>With the development of the Internet, our computers became part of a network that includes millions of other computers.  We’re happy to share information, certainly, but only with people we trust. We want to be sure that the right, accurate information is in the right hands. As more information is stored digitally, the need for computer security grows. </p>

<p>But who is developing the security software, and how effective is it? A primary benefit of free and open source software is that it can be analyzed by anyone interested in understanding how it works. The public nature of the code means it is more likely that any holes or flaws can be identified and fixed.</p>

<p>This is preferable to companies and groups creating and using security software that can’t be publicly analyzed and checked for flaws. Security software is strongest when all of the code is public, as it helps to ensure the challenging security and encryption features are properly designed. It is important when we trust our sensitive information to software that we can verify it does what it claims to do and is acting in the best interest of the user, not the company. While it may seem strange at first telling, secrets are best kept with software that itself is not secret.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<h1 id="pis">Problems in security</h1>

<p>The benefits of having access to a nearly infinite amount of knowledge and information should be balanced with our increased vulnerability. Being connected to servers and computers that may be running software designed with malicious intent is an ongoing problem.</p>

<p>The world’s population will inevitably become more computer literate. While that is undoubtedly a good thing overall, it also increases our dependence on a system vulnerable to individuals who might potentially lead attacks to steal information or block access.</p>

<h1 id="wdtfl">Where does the future lead?</h1>

<p>As more of our information becomes digital, the need for strong trustworthy security increases. We will likely see more “smart” hardware in our homes and the larger human environment. The very fact that this hardware is “connected” makes your home potentially less private.</p>

<p>Imagine that you’re heading off for a much needed winter vacation. You set your smart thermostat to keep your home cool while you’re away, and to turn on your heating again in a week–just before you return home. Anyone who can access this information would suspect that there will be no-one in the house that week, leaving it vulnerable to a break-in. Security and privacy is needed here, too.</p>

<p>In the long run, there will be an increasing number of attacks by nefariously minded parties. Building software with security features is common place, however it is harder to find software that is secure by default. Thankfully the last few years have helped a number of free and open source security projects mature into reliable tools.</p>

<p><strong>Tor</strong></p>

<p><img src="/open-journalism-project/img/security/tor.png" alt="tor" /></p>

<p>Site: <a href="https://www.torproject.org">torproject.org</a></p>

<p>Github: <a href="https://github.com/TheTorProject">github.com/TheTorProject</a></p>

<p>Tor is one of the more popular pieces of open source security software because of the large community working to make it better and the increasing need to anonymize browsing traffic.</p>

<p>The Tor project makes available a browser (<a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en">the Tor Browser</a>), like Chrome, that allows you to surf the web, but with the goal of anonymizing your traffic. Tor achieves its anonymity by bouncing your communications around a distributed network of relays run by volunteers around the world helping keep your physical location and web traffic hidden.</p>

<p><strong>Tails - the amnesic incognito live system</strong></p>

<p>Site: <a href="https://tails.boum.org/">https://tails.boum.org/</a></p>

<p>Git: <a href="https://git-tails.immerda.ch/">https://git-tails.immerda.ch/</a></p>

<p>Tails is an operating system, like Windows or OSX, but designed explicitly for security and privacy. It comes preloaded with both Tor and Onionshare and is an easy way to get started with many privacy focused tools. Tails is designed to be loaded onto a CD or a USB stick and used as-needed without replacing your existing day to day operating system outright.</p>

<p>Github: <a href="https://github.com/micahflee/onionshare/">github.com/micahflee/onionshare</a></p>

<p>Onionshare is a file-sharing service built on top of the distributed anonymity network Tor. Onionshare allows you to make a file on your computer temporarily available to others with a Tor browser through a special URL. The file sharing is both anonymous and secure against eavesdroppers.</p>

<p><strong>SecureDrop</strong></p>

<p>SecureDrop is a lot like Dropbox, but focused on security and anonymity. It was developed to allow whistleblowers to submit anonymized material to specific organizations. A few news organization now have their own SecureDrop system to allow information and stories to be submitted securely.</p>

<p><strong>Cryptocat</strong></p>

<p>Github: <a href="https://github.com/cryptocat/cryptocat">github.com/cryptocat/cryptocat</a></p>

<p>Cryptocat is browser extension that runs on Chrome, Firefox, or Safari. Cryptocat works by encrypting all chat before it gets sent to the Cryptocat servers, so only the users you intend to participate in the conversation can read your messages.</p>

<p>It’s a much easier and friendlier experience than some of security focused communication software, but as they say on their website, it’s not 100% bulletproof. All software is prone to bugs and holes that can bypass the encryption and make your communication less private.</p>
