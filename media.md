<h1 id="hwgh">How we got here</h1>

Why do we use videos and photos in addition to words in news; because the English is limiting.

Media such as audio, video, and images are used because words can only express so much information to the viewer. When we want to more accuratly bring a viewer into a specific scene, whether that be a protest or sporting event, it helps to use a medium that accuratly captures the scene.

As the art of photography developed from the late 1800's, it allowed for more accurate representations comapred to a written description or hand-drawn pictures. The advacement from analogue to digital media meant the amount of images and video was only limited by the byte size of the disk you were saving the media to.

The web of the early 1990's was primarily text based because the lines that connected computers couldn't carry high loads of information. If you think of it like a bridge, early Internet connections could only handle the weight of humans on bikes, not any large transport trucks. Any images that were uploaded then were low resolution, and therefore easier to download. 

The increase in quality of photo and videos sensors, which has led to higher resolution media, and therefore needing larger badwidth capabilities has been closely followed by the ability of our connections to the Internet. During this time our connections having grown from dial-up speeds of [50 kilobits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dial-up_Internet_access) per second to up to [1000 megabits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Fiber) (1 gigabit) per second; a 20,000x increase.

If we think back to our bridge metaphor, the we now have a bridge that is a well built steel structure that can withstand a steady stream of transport trucks.



<h1 id="pim">Problems in media</h1>

One of the interesting limits to using video and images on the web is that, since it’s inseption, video has been limited to bandwidth. Your capabilities of your line into the internet predicted your end experience when trying to view media from the Internet.

This limitation has meant only in the last 10 years has video really taken off as a medium online. Youtube as well as other early video sites proved that leaning hard on the barriers to speed would allow them to create new media experiences on the web.

We’ve seen a very similar constaint with cell phone bandwidth over the last decade, which has meant only recently have sites and mobile apps started doing heavier media focused work.

It's still strongly advised that any media project placed online respect a user's variable connection, and therefore make media that is sensitive to viewer’s phone data charges.

We are consuming more video and audio than ever before, but it's important to remember that stoping and focusing on complex media that involves video is not perfect for a lot of times when people are on the go but also connected with their phones.

The experiences you build with media should reflect that not everyone is in a quite place, or has the ability to afford deep attention.



<h1 id="wdtfl">Where does the future lead</h1>

As we build better standards for audio and video, and bandwidth becomes less of a barrier, more experimentation with what audio and video will be used for in the future can be done.

We will likely see more capabilities for offline access as memory and ability to save content increases. As our devices become more connected, it also means the quantity of times they become unconnected will increase.

Building offline features that allow us to still consume multimedia like audio and video will like see more attention in the future as phones abilities increase and native applications start including offline content by default.

**Popcorn.js**

![popcorn]( {{ site.baseurl }}/img/media/popcornjs.png)

Site: [popcornjs.org](http://popcornjs.org/)

Github: [github.com/mozilla/popcorn-js](https://github.com/mozilla/popcorn-js)

Popcorn.js's goal is to make video more interactive. Currently the amount of information that a viewer can get from a video is finite and dependant on the content of the video. With Popcorn.js you can add many different types of media such as maps, links, and images to help create a better and deeper story.

Soundcite allows for audio to be done inline with the text. This can be powerful when tied to a story that involves audible components that can greatly add to a story like interviews, protests, or music.

Hyperaudio is a both a web tool and library to make video and the language used within the videos more interactive. The Hyperaudio pad allows you to take parts of different videos by selecting specific parts by their transcripts and remixing them.
