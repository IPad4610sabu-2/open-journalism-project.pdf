<h1 id="hwgh">How we got here</h1>

Why do we use videos and photos in addition to words in news? One of the reasons is because of the limitations of text.

Media such as audio, video, and images are used because words can only express so much information to the audience member. When we want to more accurately bring a viewer into a specific scene, whether that be a protest or sporting event, it helps to use a medium which accurately captures the scene.

As the art of photography developed from the late 1800's, it allowed for better representations compared to a written description or hand-drawn illustrations. The advances from analogue to digital media meant that the amount of images and video was limited solely by the byte size of the disk one was saving the media to.

The web of the early 1990's was primarily text-based because the lines that connected computers couldn't yet carry heavy loads of information. If you think of it as a bridge, early Internet connections could only handle the weight of humans on bikes, not large transport trucks. Any images which were uploaded in that time period were low resolution (compared to today), and therefore easier to download. 

The increasing quality of photo and videos sensors has led to higher resolution media and a need for larger bandwidth capabilities. During this time our connections having grown from dial-up speeds of [50 kilobits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dial-up_Internet_access) per second to up to [1000 megabits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Fiber) (1 gigabit) per second; a 20,000x increase.

If we think back to our bridge metaphor, we now have a bridge which is a well-built steel structure that can withstand a steady stream of multiple transport trucks.


<h1 id="pim">Problems in media</h1>

One of the interesting constraints to using video and images on the web is that, since it’s inception, video has been limited to bandwidth. The capabilities of your line into the internet predicted your end experience when trying to view media on the Internet.

This limitation has meant only in the last 10 years has video really taken off as an online medium. Youtube as well as other early video sites proved that leaning hard on the barriers to speed would allow them to create brand-new media experiences on the web.

We’ve seen a very similar constraint with cell phone bandwidth over the last decade, which has meant that only fairly recently have sites and mobile apps started doing heavier media focused work.

It's still strongly advised that any media project placed online respect a user's variable connection, and therefore the added requirement to attempt making media which is sensitive to viewer’s phone data charges.

While we are consuming more video and audio than ever before, but it's important to remember that stopping and focusing on complex media that involves video is hardly perfect for all the times people are on the go but also plugged in with their phones.

The experiences you build with media should reflect that not everyone is in a quiet place, or can afford deep attention.



<h1 id="wdtfl">Where does the future lead?</h1>

As we build better standards for audio and video, and bandwidth becomes less of a pressing constraint, further experimentation with what audio and video can (and must) be used for in the future will happen.

We will likely see more capabilities for offline access as memory and ability to save content increases. As our devices become more connected, it also means the times in which they are disconnected will decrease.

Building offline features that allow us to consume multimedia like audio and video will likely see more attention in the future as cellphone abilities increase and native applications start storing content offline by default.

**Popcorn.js**

![popcorn]( {{ site.baseurl }}/img/media/popcornjs.png)

Site: [popcornjs.org](http://popcornjs.org/)

Github: [github.com/mozilla/popcorn-js](https://github.com/mozilla/popcorn-js)

Popcorn.js's goal is to make video more interactive. Currently the amount of information that a viewer can get from a video is finite and dependant on the content of the video. With Popcorn.js you can add many different types of media such as maps, links, and images to help create a better and deeper story.

Soundcite allows for audio to be done inline with the text. This can be powerful when tied to a story that involves audible components that can greatly add to a story like interviews, protests, or music.

Hyperaudio is a both a web tool and library to make video and the language used within the videos more interactive. The Hyperaudio pad allows you to take parts of different videos by selecting specific parts by their transcripts and remixing them.
