<h1 id="hwgh">How we got here</h1>

Why do we use videos and photos in addition to words in news; because the English is limiting. Computers are good at repition, but humans are good at emotion.

When you’re taking photos or videos to be used to tell a story, it’s one of the best ways for different brains to take information and see a moment.

Skilled wordsmiths can defintely paint the real world with a pen, but even so, images and videos will always have a home where words can be fickle.





<h1 id="pim">Problems in media</h1>

One of the interesting limits to using video and images on the web is that, since it’s inseption, video has been limited to bandwidth, or your end product has been a function of the spped of the average internet connection.

This limitation has meant only in the last 10 years has video really taken off as a medium online. Youtube as well as other early video sites proved that leaning hard on the barriers to speed would allow them to create new media experiences on the web.

Now sharing high resolution images and videos is much more normal. We’ve seen a very similar constaint with cell phone bandwidth over the last decade, which has meant only recently have site and mobile apps started doing heavier media focused work.

It's still strongly advised that any media project placed online be minimized with respect to size as to limit the endured cost from the viewer’s phone data charges. 

Although we do consume more rich content both audio and video require intimate attention and thus are hard to fit into a smartphone use case.


<h1 id="wdtfl">Where does the future lead</h1>

As we build better standards for audio and video, and bandwidth becomes less of a barrier, more experimentation with what audio and video will be used for in the future can be done.

We will likely see more capabilities for offline access as memory and ability to save content increases. As our devices become more connected, it also means the quantity of times they become unconnected will increase.

Building offline features that allow us to still consume multimedia like audio and video will like see more attention in the future as phones abilities increase and native applications start including offline content by default.

**Popcorn.js**

![popcorn]( {{ site.baseurl }}/img/media/popcornjs.png)

Site: [popcornjs.org](http://popcornjs.org/)

Github: [github.com/mozilla/popcorn-js](https://github.com/mozilla/popcorn-js)

Popcorn.js's goal is to make video more interactive. Currently the amount of information that a viewer can get from a video is finite and dependant on the content of the video. With Popcorn.js you can add many different types of media such as maps, links, and images to help create a better and deeper story.

Soundcite allows for audio to be done inline with the text. This can be powerful when tied to a story that involves audible components that can greatly add to a story like interviews, protests, or music.
