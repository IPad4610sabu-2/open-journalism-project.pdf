<h1 id="hwgh">How we got here</h1>

Why do we use videos and photos in addition to words in news? One of the reasons is because text has some limitations.

Words can only express so much information to the audience, so we add media such as audio, video, and images. When we want to more accurately or quickly bring a viewer into a specific situation, whether a protest or sporting event, it helps if we can use a medium that accurately captures the scene.

Different media have different strengths and weaknesses. Newspapers in the early days included illustrations that were created from engravings based on hand-drawn illustrations. Later, in the mid-1800s, engravings were sometimes based on photographs. These engravings communicated a scene or an object quickly and effectively to the reader. However, they were time-consuming to make and were rarely used to capture "on the ground" news situations. As the art of photography developed during the late 1800s and half-tone printing became possible, newspapers began to print photographs. These images showed a scene with more immediacy than an engraving. Think of the front-page images of wartime Europe.

Moving images - from jerky film strips to slow-motion videos - have the potential to convey even more information than stills. The eye evolved to follow motion, so we are drawn to a picture moving on a screen. 

As we moved from analogue to digital media the quality of movies changed considerably. When we could store images and videos digitally, their number and quality was limited only by the number of bytes of information that a disk could hold.

The web of the early 1990s was primarily text-based because the wires that connected computers couldn't yet carry heavy loads of information. If you think of it as a bridge, early Internet connections could only handle the weight of humans on bikes, not large transport trucks. Any images that were uploaded were low resolution (compared to today), and therefore easier to download. Even so, it could take several seconds or even minutes to download a photograph via a modem.

The increasing quality of photo and videos sensors has led to higher resolution media and a need for larger bandwidth capabilities. During this time our connections having grown from dial-up speeds of [50 kilobits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dial-up_Internet_access) per second to up to [1000 megabits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Fiber) (1 gigabit) per second; a 20,000x increase.

Thinking back to our bridge metaphor, we now have a bridge which is a well-built steel structure that can withstand a steady stream of fully laden transport trucks.


<h1 id="pim">Problems in media</h1>

One of the interesting constraints to sharing video and images on the web is that, since its inception, video uploading and downloading has been limited by bandwidth. The capabilities of your line into the internet predicted your end experience when trying to view media on the Internet.

This limitation has meant that only in the last 10 years has video really taken off as an online medium. YouTube and other other early video sites proved that leaning hard on the barriers to speed enabled the creation of brand-new media experiences on the web.

We’ve seen a very similar constraint with cell phone bandwidth over the last decade, which has meant that only fairly recently have sites and mobile apps started doing heavier media focused work.

It's still strongly advised that any media project placed online respect a user's variable connection, and therefore the added requirement to attempt making media which is sensitive to viewer’s phone data charges.

While we are consuming more video and audio than ever before, but it's important to remember that stopping and focusing on complex media that involves video is hardly perfect for all the times people are on the go but also plugged in with their phones.

The experiences you build with media should reflect that not everyone is in a quiet place, or can afford deep attention.



<h1 id="wdtfl">Where does the future lead?</h1>

As we build better standards for audio and video, and bandwidth becomes less of a pressing constraint, further experimentation with what audio and video can (and must) be used for in the future will happen.

We will likely see more capabilities for offline access as memory and ability to save content increases. As our devices become more connected, it also means the times in which they are disconnected will decrease.

Building offline features that allow us to consume multimedia like audio and video will likely see more attention in the future as cellphone abilities increase and native applications start storing content offline by default.

**Popcorn.js**

![popcorn]( {{ site.baseurl }}/img/media/popcornjs.png)

Site: [popcornjs.org](http://popcornjs.org/)

Github: [github.com/mozilla/popcorn-js](https://github.com/mozilla/popcorn-js)

Popcorn.js's goal is to make video more interactive. Currently the amount of information that a viewer can get from a video is finite and dependant on the content of the video. With Popcorn.js you can add many different types of media such as maps, links, and images to help create a better and deeper story.

Soundcite allows for audio to be done inline with the text. This can be powerful when tied to a story that involves audible components that can greatly add to a story like interviews, protests, or music.

Hyperaudio is a both a web tool and library to make video and the language used within the videos more interactive. The Hyperaudio pad allows you to take parts of different videos by selecting specific parts by their transcripts and remixing them.
